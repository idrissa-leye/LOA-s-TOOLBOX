LOA's TOOLBOX is a software that group the basic common redist that you may need to run your games on windows 10/11. You will find their latest version on their official website. 
I've decided to build this app to prevent people from visiting 10+ websites to download theses redist. It's useful for thoses who are starting their gaming journey and thoses experiencing some errors when launching old games. 
The common redist in question are the followings:
*Java Runtime Environment 8
*NVIDIA PhysX
*Direct X 11
*Direct X 9.0c
*Microsoft Desktop Runtime 8.0.4
*Microsoft Net Framework 3.5
*Open Alist
*UE4 pre-requisite
*XNA Game Studio
*Visual Studio 2008 (x86 & x64 bits)
*Visual Studio 2010 (x86 & x64 bits)
*Visual Studio 2015 (x86 & x64 bits)
I've used python with the flet module/framework to build this app. You will not find the complete package in this repositorie because i can't upload file larger than 25mb so i've decided to put the link of the drive inside a txt file.
Just download the "link here.txt", open it, copy the link and paste it in your browser and then you can download the LOA's TOOLBOX package.
